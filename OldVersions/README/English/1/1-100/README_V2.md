# SeansLifeArchive_Images_PocketFrogs
The module for my life story project that contains my Pocket Frogs images.

***

## About

See above This repository hosts all my weekly Pocket Frogs session pictures.

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I originally started playing Pocket Frogs on iOS in 2012. I didn't have much interest in the game at the time and I stopped playing pretty quickly (on the same day of installation)

In 2020, with my NimbleBit fan phase, I started playing Pocket Frogs again. I still play on a weekly basis. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimblebit.pocketfrogs&hl=en&gl=us).

# Pocket Frogs March 29th 2021 session

I had a good Pocket Frogs session today. I played a bit longer than normal

## Nursery

I moved and sold all frogs from the nursery from the last session and added 8 new frog eggs

## Breeding

I bred 8 new frogs today.

## Mailbox

I got 2 frogs out of the mailbox today. I intend to clean my mailbox out soon when I get more habitats.

## Ad boosts

Today, I decided to let ads run to try and further build up my potion and stamp collection (that I currently don't plan on using)

I came across the disturbing ad again, so I decided not to document it as much.

## Frog level

Currently, the rarest frog I have gotten to is of rarity 7. It might be different next week.

## Coins

Todays priority was to breed rare frogs to sell for coins. I am filling up a habitat with rarity 7 frogs, then I will start selling rarity 7 frogs that are extras.

I ended the day with 11,848 coins.

## Potions

I watched ads for many new potions today. I was going to go to 100, but I decided to stop at 95, so I could get some more time today.

## Stamps

I watched ads for many new stamps today. I was going to go to 100, but I decided to stop at 95, so I could get some more time today.

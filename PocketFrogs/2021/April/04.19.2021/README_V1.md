# Pocket Frogs session April 19th 2021

I had a normal length session today, and made a decent amount of money, and began breeding 8 new frogs. I am still working towards getting a level 8 rarity frog.

Today, I sold 10 frogs, received new mail, and worked on trying to see patterns with long trips in the pond (going straight for 100+ lillypads)

## Overview

See above.

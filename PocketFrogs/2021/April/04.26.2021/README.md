# Pocket Frogs session April 26th 2021

I had a normal length session today, and made a decent amount of money, and began breeding 8 new frogs. I got my first 2 level 8 frogs via mail, and now I am able to breed them. They sell for over 2000 coins each, and it will be very helpful for short term future progress. I didn't think I would get level 8 frogs today, I was just thinking about how to breed them on my own, but I have them now.

Today, I sold 10 frogs, received new mail, and made some profit. I don't know if my 6th habitat was previously full, I will check, but it is now a habitat for my level 8 starter frogs.

## Overview

See above.

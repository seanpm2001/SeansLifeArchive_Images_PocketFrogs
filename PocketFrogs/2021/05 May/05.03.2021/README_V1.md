# Pocket Frogs session May 3rd 2021

I had a normal length session today, and made a small amount of money, and began breeding 8 new frogs. I managed to breed several frogs with the NimbleBit logo, and I want to keep 8 of them, so I didn't sell for very much today.

Today, I sold 11 frogs, received new mail, and made some profit.

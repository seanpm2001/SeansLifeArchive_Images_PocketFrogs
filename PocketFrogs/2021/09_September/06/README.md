# Pocket Frogs session 2021 September 6th

I had a very long session today, making a good amount of money, and began breeding 8 new frogs. My max frog level is currently 10.

Today, I sold several frogs (? frogs total), received new mail, and made a small bit of progress. The session took a long time to complete due to very poor luck with frog breeding. I did not play extra today, I quit when I reached all my goals. It took a while to reach all the goals though.

I did not level up or buy any new habitats today, but I came close to both goals.

## Overview

# Pocket Frogs session 2021 September 13th

I had a very long session today, making a good amount of money, and began breeding 8 new frogs. My max frog level is currently 11.

Today, I sold several frogs (10 frogs total), received new mail, and made a small bit of progress. The session took an extremely long time to complete due to very poor luck with frog breeding. I did not play extra today, I quit when I reached all my goals. It took a while to reach all the goals though. I dealt with a lot of flies IRL and it really sucked. There were ~8 in the house, and they would follow me in between rooms to harass me. _it would be nice if the frogs from this game could have came out and ate them all._ I had some empathy for the flies yesterday, but I can now confirm I am not going to miss this at all in the winter time.

I did not level up today, but I bought a new habitat for my new rarity 11 frogs. I am still figuring out frog breeding, and I did an experiment today and bred frogs with a level 10 instead of a level 11, as the breeding cost is getting too high and has a bad ratio. The current strategy is to try and breed level 6-11 frogs with a level 10 frog, level 7 to 12 frogs with a level 11 frog, and so on.

I remembered something today in childhood memory format, and I am wondering if it was from this game in 2011-2013 or a different game. I vaguely remember some frog game having spinning lilypads before you can make the frog move, and I feel like this game used to be like that. I haven't played many frog related games in my life, the only one that comes close is frogger. I really feel like either this game or frogger had spinning lilypads, and I have a feeling that Pocket Frogs did, but I can't confirm it yet.

I had a difficult morning today, and dealt with an uncontrollable amount of tension and jaw pain. This game helped ease that over the hour or longer length session.

# Freeing the frogs

I am quitting Pocket Frogs, and leaving the NimbleVerse frog swamp for good. I have decided that I am not going to play this game anymore, I haven't in quite some time, and I don't feel like playing anymore.

## Conclusion

Today (2021 Monday, November 15th) I didn't play this game (Pocket Frogs) as I have quit playing. This was done because I got tired of the game and its impact on my schedule, and felt like I got enough done here. There will be no further screenshots, unless something changes in the future.

I originally planned to stop playing for good on either Monday November 1st or Monday November 8th, but I forgot both times. I made sure last night that I wouldn't forget today (2021, Monday, November 15th)

I was going to try and get every type of frog, but gameplay has become too repetitive, and I need time for other projects.
